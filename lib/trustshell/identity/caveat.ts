//
// Caveats: the limits attached to a grant that capabilities alone cannot
// express. `pay:usdc` says which door is open; `maxValue 100 USDC` says how far
// through it the holder may walk.
//
// AN UNENFORCED CAVEAT IS WORSE THAN NO CAVEAT.
//
// This is why the type below is small and why `maxCalls` is treated differently
// from the rest. A caveat sitting in a signed grant reads as a control: an
// operator seeing `maxCalls: 5` reasonably concludes the sixth call is refused.
// If nothing counts calls, that conclusion is false and the grant is actively
// misleading — worse than a grant that never claimed the limit, because it
// bought confidence it cannot honour.
//
// So caveats are split by what enforcement actually requires:
//
//   STATELESS — decidable from the request in front of you. `maxValue`,
//               `toolAllowlist`. Enforced today, and returning VERIFIED means
//               it really was checked.
//   STATEFUL  — needs memory across requests. `maxCalls` cannot be decided from
//               one request, so without a counter store it reports NOT_CHECKED
//               with the reason. It never silently passes.
//
// That mirrors the nonce store: `SupabaseNonceStore` throws rather than
// returning "unspent" when its table is missing, for the same reason.
//
// CAVEATS ATTENUATE. A child may tighten a parent's limit and never loosen it.
// A delegate holding `maxValue 100` cannot mint a sub-delegate with
// `maxValue 1000`, and — the case that is easy to miss — cannot mint one with
// NO maxValue at all. Dropping a caveat is loosening it.
